!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Cryopreserved PBMC were thawed, stimulated with peptides in a 24h AIM assay (Dan et al. 2016), stained with antibodies, and an average of 10,000 antigen-specfic cells sorted using BD Aria 3 or BD Aria Fusion cell sorter direclty in Trizol.  TCM and TEM were defined as the combination of CCR7+CD45RA- or CCR7-CD45RA- populations respectively. Total RNA was purified using a miRNAeasy micro kit (Qiagen, USA) and quantified by qPCR as described previously (Seumois et al., 2012).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Purified total RNA (1 to 5 ng) was amplified following the (microscaled) smart-seq2 protocol (16 cycles of cDNA amplification) (Picelli et al., 2014). cDNA was purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). From this step, 1 ng of cDNA was used to prepare a standard Nextera XT sequencing library (Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit and index kit, Illumina).

!Sample_data_processing = The single-end reads that passed Illumina filters were filtered for reads aligning to tRNA, rRNA, adapter sequences, and spike-in controls. The reads were then aligned to UCSC hg19 reference genome using TopHat (v 1.4.1) (Trapnell et al., 2009). DUST scores were calculated with PRINSEQ Lite (v 0.20.3) (Schmieder et al., 2011) and low-complexity reads (DUST > 4) were removed from the BAM files.  The alignment results were parsed via the SAMtools (Li et al., 2009) to generate SAM files. Read counts to each genomic feature were obtained with the htseq-count program (v 0.6.0) (Anders et al., 2014) using the “union” option.
